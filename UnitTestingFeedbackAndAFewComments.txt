Unit Tests Coverage is poor:
	Class: 35%
	Method: 41%
	Line: 51%
Exceptions and resources has 0% of coverage.
@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING) this is not a good practice(Dependencies)
Too much repeated code instead of using @Before.
			SidesService tester = new SidesService is called several times.
test4IsNotBase64String is doing too much asserts. Each assert is one test case
Use of assertEquals instead assertTrue or assertFalse
Multiple assertEquals to verify same object. Use assertThat
No tests for "Right side contains no value." on validateDiff method
No tests for getAllSides method


#################Things I would check before start automating, if I had contact with the developers######################
AddSideValue is adding a String that is not exactly  in json format. (this implementantion does not smells good).
	E.g: {"Left: "W43S"}
AddSideValue accepting empty strings
Negative Id are accepted
Characters like "+ and \" are not accepted. (Ok It may work on that way)
AddSideValue is not accepting padding. E.g: "W43=")

#################Things that I would like to implement but i could not.######################
Passing the Host as a mvn property.  Eg. -Dhost=http://localhost:8081  (To avoid hardcoded hosts)
Passing a XML as mvn property. Eg. -DTestXML=regression.xml (To run any testng xml)
