Unit Tests Coverage is poor:
	Class: 35%
	Method: 41%
	Line: 51%
Exceptions and resources has 0% of coverage.
@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING) this is not a good practice(Dependencies)
Too much repeated code instead of using @Before.
			SidesService tester = new SidesService is called several times.
test4IsNotBase64String is doing too much asserts. Each assert is one test case
Use of assertEquals instead assertTrue or assertFalse
Multiple assertEquals to verify same object. Use assertThat
No tests for "Right side contains no value." on validateDiff method
No tests for getAllSides method
